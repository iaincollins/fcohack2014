                About Tinata
            </h1>
            <p>
               <strong>Tinata</strong> (<em>pronounced tin-a-tap-e</em>) stands for "<em>Tinata Is Not A Travel API</em>" - a pun on the notion that it contains information useful to travellers but has not been <em>exlusively</em> created with travellers in mind;
               the data is also extremly useful for a wide range of purposes such as data journalism, adding value to existing software and for integrating different datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tinata</strong> is a <strong>free service</strong>, released as <strong>public domain software</strong> and is <strong>provided without warrenty</strong> (see <a href="#terms_and_conditions">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> for details).
            </p>

            <h3>About the service</h3>
            <p>
                You are free to use, modify and republish the data exposed by the <strong>Tinata</strong> for both commerical and non-commerical purposes,
                provided it is appropriately attributed.
            </p>
            <p>
                 The 'attribution' property, present only when attribution is actually required, provides full details of appropriate attribution you should use when republishing data (e.g. <em>travelAdvice.attribution</em> provides attribution information for the Travel Advice section).
            </p>
            <p>
                Not all information is available for all countries. Where data is not available for a particular country (e.g. travel advice, population statistics, etc) no property is returned.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to report any potential licensing issues, problems with the service or to suggest additional open datasets that could be incorporated please <a href="https://github.com/tinata/Tinata/issues">raise issues on GitHub</a> or <a href="mailto:Tinata@iaincollins.com?subject=Tinata">get in touch via email</a>.
